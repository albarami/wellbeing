# 🔐 Private Deployment Guide - Link-Only Access

## 🎯 Your Requirements

✅ Only people with the link can access  
✅ Not publicly searchable  
✅ Password-protected OR private Space  

---

## 🚀 Option 1: Password-Protected App (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Sharing with trusted group, easy password distribution

### ✅ Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Add password to your `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Open .env file and add:
   APP_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!
   ```

2. **Run the password-protected version**
   ```powershell
   cd "D:\Academic debate"
   chainlit run chainlit_app_with_auth.py
   ```

3. **Share with users:**
   - Send them the URL (localhost or deployed URL)
   - Send them the password separately (email, WhatsApp, etc.)
   - They enter username (any name) and the password

### 🌐 Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces (Private Mode)

1. **Create Private Space**
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/new-space
   - Name: `academic-debate-council`
   - SDK: Docker
   - **Visibility: Private** ← Important!
   - Click "Create Space"

2. **Update Dockerfile to use auth version**
   ```dockerfile
   # Change the CMD line in Dockerfile to:
   CMD ["chainlit", "run", "chainlit_app_with_auth.py", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "7860"]
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy with password protection"
   git push huggingface main -f
   ```

4. **Add Repository Secrets**
   - Go to Space Settings → Repository Secrets
   - Add: `APP_PASSWORD` = Your password
   - Add: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = Your API key

5. **Share Access**
   - In Space Settings → "Manage access"
   - Click "Share with specific users"
   - Add users by their Hugging Face username
   - They need to be logged into Hugging Face to access

**Your private URL:**
```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/academic-debate-council
```

Only users you specifically grant access + have the password can use it.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION

### For Quick Private Sharing:

**Use Password-Protected App**

1. **Edit your `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   APP_PASSWORD=ChooseStrongPassword123!
   ```

2. **Run locally with password:**
   ```powershell
   chainlit run chainlit_app_with_auth.py
   ```

3. **Deploy to Hugging Face (Private Space):**
   ```powershell
   # Double-click: DEPLOY_TO_HUGGINGFACE.bat
   # When creating Space, select "Private"
   ```

4. **Share:**
   - Send URL to trusted users
   - Send password separately
   - They login with any username + your password

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Strong Password Requirements:
```
✅ At least 12 characters
✅ Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
✅ Not a dictionary word
✅ Unique to this application

Example: Sch0lar$Deb@te2024!
```

### Sharing the Password:
- ❌ Don't email password with URL
- ✅ Send via separate channel (SMS, WhatsApp)
- ✅ Use password manager to generate strong password
- ✅ Change password if you suspect compromise

### Monitoring Usage:
- Check Anthropic API usage dashboard
- Each debate costs ~$0.10-0.30
- Set billing alerts
- Monitor for unusual activity

## 📝 Quick Start Script

Save as `setup_private_access.ps1`:

```powershell
# Setup Private Access

Write-Host "🔐 Setting up private access..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Check if .env exists
if (-Not (Test-Path ".env")) {
    Copy-Item ".env.example" ".env"
    Write-Host "✅ Created .env file" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "✅ .env file exists" -ForegroundColor Green
}

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Please set your APP_PASSWORD in .env file" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. Open .env file"
Write-Host "2. Find APP_PASSWORD line"
Write-Host "3. Change to a strong password"
Write-Host ""

$continue = Read-Host "Have you set a strong password? (Y/N)"

if ($continue -eq "Y" -or $continue -eq "y") {
    Write-Host ""
    Write-Host "🚀 Starting password-protected app..." -ForegroundColor Green
    chainlit run chainlit_app_with_auth.py
} else {
    Write-Host "Please set your password in .env first!" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

Run with:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup_private_access.ps1
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Password Protection

1. **Start the app**
   ```powershell
   chainlit run chainlit_app_with_auth.py
   ```

2. **Open browser**: http://localhost:8000

3. **You should see login screen**
   - Enter any username
   - Enter the password from your `.env`

4. **Test wrong password**
   - Should be rejected

5. **Test correct password**
   - Should grant access

---

## 🌐 Deployment with Password Protection

### Update Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Change last line to use auth version
CMD ["chainlit", "run", "chainlit_app_with_auth.py", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "7860"]
```

### Deploy to Hugging Face:

```powershell
# 1. Update Dockerfile
# 2. Set Space to Private
# 3. Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy with password protection"
git push huggingface main -f

# 4. Add APP_PASSWORD in Repository Secrets
```

## 📞 Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Invalid credentials" on login**
   - Check password in `.env` matches what you're typing
   - No extra spaces in `.env` file
   - Password is case-sensitive

2. **Still showing public on Hugging Face**
   - Go to Space Settings
   - Change Visibility to "Private"
   - Rebuild Space

3. **Users can't access private Space**
   - They need Hugging Face account
   - Add them in Space Settings → "Share with specific users"
   - Give them the password separately
