# WebSocket Timeout Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The application was showing "Could not reach the server" error and freezing at Task 2/12 when agents tried to use verification tools (like `get_quran_verse_standalone`).

## Root Cause
When the agent executed API calls (Quran API, Hadith API, etc.), there were periods of 10-30 seconds where **no data was sent to the Chainlit frontend**. This caused the WebSocket connection to timeout and disconnect, showing "Could not reach the server".

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Background Heartbeat Task ‚≠ê **KEY FIX**
**File:** `chainlit_app.py` (lines 274-292, 332-339)

```python
# Background task that sends keep-alive signals every 5 seconds
async def send_heartbeat():
    heartbeat_count = 0
    while not streaming_complete:
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
        if not streaming_complete:
            heartbeat_count += 1
            if heartbeat_count % 3 == 0:
                await agent_msg.stream_token(".")  # Visible progress
            else:
                await agent_msg.stream_token("")  # Invisible keep-alive
```

**Impact:** Ensures WebSocket **always** receives data every 5 seconds, even during long API calls.

### 2. API Retry Logic with Progressive Timeouts
**File:** `src/academic_debate_council/tools/islamic_texts.py` (lines 338-430)

```python
# Retry with increasing timeouts
max_retries = 2
timeouts = [5, 10]  # First try 5s, then 10s

for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=timeouts[attempt])
        # ... handle response
    except (Timeout, ConnectionError):
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            continue  # Try again
```

**Impact:** Handles temporary network issues and gives slow APIs more time on second attempt.

### 3. Stream Speed Reduction
**File:** `src/academic_debate_council/direct_chat_agents.py` (lines 732, 764, 777)

```python
# Delay between text chunks
time.sleep(0.01)  # 10ms

# Delay before tool execution
time.sleep(0.5)   # 500ms

# Delay after tool result
time.sleep(0.3)   # 300ms
```

**Impact:** Prevents API rate limiting and gives external services time to respond.

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
**File:** `src/academic_debate_council/direct_chat_agents.py` (lines 766-771)

```python
try:
    tool_result = self._execute_tool(tool_name, tool_input)
except Exception as tool_error:
    tool_result = f"‚ö†Ô∏è Tool execution error: {str(tool_error)[:200]}"
```

**Impact:** Tool failures no longer crash the entire debate - agents continue with partial information.

### 5. Task-Level Timeout Protection
**File:** `chainlit_app.py` (lines 305-310)

```python
task_timeout = 240  # 4 minutes max per agent
if time.time() - task_start > task_timeout:
    timeout_msg = "Task timeout - Moving to next agent..."
    break
```

**Impact:** Even if an agent gets stuck, the system automatically continues to the next task.

### 6. WebSocket Configuration
**File:** `.chainlit/config.toml` (lines 17-22)

```toml
session_timeout = 7200
websocket_ping_interval = 10
websocket_ping_timeout = 60
```

**Impact:** Increased session timeout and configured WebSocket ping intervals.

## How to Test

### Option 1: Use the Startup Script
```bash
START_CHAINLIT.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
cd "D:\Academic debate"
chainlit run chainlit_app.py
```

### Option 3: Test API Directly
```bash
python test_timeout_fix.py
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken)
1. Agent starts Task 2/12
2. Calls `get_quran_verse_standalone(2, 256)`
3. API takes 10-15 seconds
4. **WebSocket times out** ‚Üí "Could not reach the server"
5. Application freezes permanently

### After (Fixed)
1. Agent starts Task 2/12
2. Calls `get_quran_verse_standalone(2, 256)`
3. **Background heartbeat sends "." every 5 seconds** ‚Üí WebSocket stays alive
4. API responds (or times out gracefully after 2 retries)
5. Agent continues with result (or error message)
6. **All 12 tasks complete successfully**

## Monitoring Progress

You'll now see:
- `üîß Executing tool: get_quran_verse_standalone` - Tool is being called
- `.` dots appearing every 15 seconds - Heartbeat keeping connection alive
- `üìä Tool result:` - Tool completed (success or error)
- Agent continues writing response

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Could not reach the server":

1. **Check your internet connection**
   - The Quran API (api.quran.com) must be reachable
   - Test: Open https://api.quran.com/api/v4/verses/by_key/2:256 in browser

2. **Check firewall/antivirus**
   - May be blocking WebSocket connections on localhost:8000
   - Add exception for `chainlit.exe` and `python.exe`

3. **Restart the Chainlit server**
   - Close the terminal running Chainlit
   - Run `START_CHAINLIT.bat` again
   - Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh)

4. **Check port 8000 availability**
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8000
   ```
   If port is in use, kill the process or use different port:
   ```bash
   chainlit run chainlit_app.py --port 8001
   ```

5. **Increase heartbeat frequency** (if still timing out)
   Edit `chainlit_app.py` line 282:
   ```python
   await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Changed from 5 to 3 seconds
   ```

## Performance Impact

- **Heartbeat overhead:** Negligible (~10 bytes per 5 seconds)
- **Stream delays:** Adds ~1-2 seconds total per agent
- **API retries:** May add 5-10 seconds on first failure
- **Overall impact:** +10-15 seconds per complete 12-task debate (acceptable trade-off for stability)

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Application completes all 12 tasks without freezing
‚úÖ "Could not reach the server" error never appears
‚úÖ Tool execution errors are shown but don't crash the system
‚úÖ WebSocket connection stays alive for entire 10-15 minute debate
‚úÖ Progress indicators (dots) visible during long operations

## Developer Notes

The critical insight here is that **Chainlit's WebSocket requires periodic activity** to stay alive.

In a normal chatbot, the LLM generates tokens continuously, naturally keeping the WebSocket alive. But in our multi-agent system with tool calling:

1. Agent sends tool request to Anthropic API
2. **Anthropic API waits** for our tool to execute
3. Our tool makes HTTP request to external API (Quran, Hadith, etc.)
4. **External API takes 5-15 seconds** to respond
5. During this time, **nothing is sent to Chainlit frontend**
6. WebSocket assumes connection is dead ‚Üí timeout

The `send_heartbeat()` background task solves this by **decoupling** heartbeat generation from the main streaming flow. It runs independently and ensures data flows to the frontend every 5 seconds, regardless of what the agent is doing.
