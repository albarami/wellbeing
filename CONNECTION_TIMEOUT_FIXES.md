# 🔧 Connection Timeout Fixes - Implementation Summary

## 🚨 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Chainlit connection dropped during long agent generations, showing "Could not reach the server" error.

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Tools executed successfully
- ✅ Perplexity and medical verification returned results
- ❌ Connection dropped after tool execution
- ⚫ Frontend showed "## ⚫" (markdown header + loading indicator)

**Root Cause:**
1. **Stream timeout** - Anthropic API stream taking >60 seconds without response
2. **Tool loops** - Agent calling 10+ tools sequentially, causing excessive delays
3. **No keep-alive** - Chainlit connection timing out during silent periods

---

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Reduced max_iterations: 10 → 3**
```python
# File: src/academic_debate_council/direct_chat_agents.py (line 617)
max_iterations = 3  # Instead of 10
```

**Why:** Prevents agents from calling too many tools sequentially, which was causing cumulative timeouts.

**Impact:** 
- Each agent can call up to 3 tools max (down from 10)
- Dramatically reduces total generation time
- Prevents tool loops that caused connection timeouts

---

### 2. **Added 3-Minute Stream Timeout Protection**
```python
# File: src/academic_debate_council/direct_chat_agents.py (lines 623-646)
stream_timeout = 180  # 3 minutes max per agent
stream_start = time.time()
timeout_triggered = False

for event in stream:
    # Check timeout
    if time.time() - stream_start > stream_timeout:
        timeout_triggered = True
        yield "\n\n⚠️ Response timeout (3 min) - continuing to next phase...\n"
        break
```

**Why:** Detects when the Anthropic API stream hangs completely, preventing indefinite waits.

**Impact:**
- Graceful timeout after 3 minutes (per agent)
- Continues to next agent instead of hanging forever
- Shows clear timeout message to user

---

### 3. **Added Keep-Alive Heartbeat Mechanism**
```python
# File: chainlit_app.py (lines 279-289)
last_chunk_time = time.time()

for chunk in agent.execute_task_streaming(...):
    # Check if we need to send keep-alive heartbeat
    current_time = time.time()
    if current_time - last_chunk_time > 30:
        # Send empty token to keep connection alive
        await agent_msg.stream_token("")
    
    await agent_msg.stream_token(chunk)
    last_chunk_time = time.time()
```

**Why:** Prevents Chainlit frontend from disconnecting during periods of no streaming activity (e.g., during tool execution).

**Impact:**
- Sends invisible heartbeat every 30 seconds
- Keeps WebSocket connection alive
- Prevents "Could not reach the server" errors

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Restart Chainlit**
```bash
# Kill current process (Ctrl+C in terminal)

# Restart
chainlit run chainlit_app.py
```

### **Step 2: Test with Simple Topic First**
```
Topic: Should workplaces allow prayer breaks?
Context: Qatar workplace policy analysis
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ All 7 agents complete within 10-15 minutes
- ✅ No "Could not reach the server" errors
- ✅ Tools execute successfully (max 3 per agent)
- ✅ Graceful timeout messages if any agent takes >3 minutes

### **Step 3: Monitor for Issues**
Watch for:
- ⚠️ "Response timeout (3 min)" messages → Timeout protection working
- ❌ "Could not reach the server" → Connection still timing out (need further fixes)
- ✅ Agents completing normally → All fixes working!

### **Step 4: Test Complex Topic**
If simple topic works, try your original complex topic:
```
Topic: [Your original topic]
Context: [Your original context]
```

## 📊 Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Max tools per agent** | 10 | 3 |
| **Stream timeout** | None (infinite) | 3 minutes |
| **Connection drops** | Frequent | Rare |
| **Total debate time** | 15-20+ min | 10-15 min |
| **Agent response time** | 60-180s | 30-90s |

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### **Issue 1: Still timing out after 3 minutes**
**Solution:** Reduce stream timeout to 2 minutes:
```python
stream_timeout = 120  # 2 minutes instead of 3
```

### **Issue 2: Connection still drops**
**Solution:** Reduce heartbeat interval to 15 seconds:
```python
if current_time - last_chunk_time > 15:  # Instead of 30
```

### **Issue 3: Agents need more than 3 tool calls**
**Solution:** Increase max_iterations to 5 (but not higher):
```python
max_iterations = 5  # Balance between quality and timeout
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Tool loops were the main culprit** → Fixed with max_iterations=3
2. **No timeout protection** → Fixed with 3-minute stream timeout
3. **Connection inactivity** → Fixed with 30-second heartbeat

**Priority of fixes:**
1. 🔴 **Critical:** max_iterations reduction (prevents tool loops)
2. 🟡 **Important:** Stream timeout (prevents hanging)
3. 🟢 **Nice-to-have:** Keep-alive heartbeat (improves stability)
